I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/), working with [Weijun Xie](https://sites.google.com/site/weijunxieor). I received my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from University of Maryland, College Park, advised by [Ilya Ryzhov](https://sites.google.com/umd.edu/iryzhov/home) and co-advised by [Bruce Golden](https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/directory/bruce-l-golden). I am interested in exact, approximation and heuristic algorithms for discrete optimization, with applications in optimal experimental design, network design and humanitarian logistics.
